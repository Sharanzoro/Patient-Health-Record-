# **Patient Health Record Dashboard**  

## **Overview**  
The **Patient Health Record Dashboard** is a data-driven healthcare application that integrates electronic health records (EHRs), lab results, and real-time vitals to provide actionable insights for healthcare providers. It leverages **machine learning** for predictive analytics, ensuring proactive patient monitoring and improved decision-making.  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Centralized Patient Data** â€“ Stores and organizes patient demographics, medical history, and test results.  
âœ… **Predictive Analytics** â€“ Identifies potential health risks using **machine learning models**.  
âœ… **Health Trends & Alerts** â€“ Tracks vitals over time and sends alerts for abnormal patterns.  
âœ… **Interactive Visualizations** â€“ Provides **charts, heatmaps, and statistical summaries** for better insights.  
âœ… **Secure & Compliant** â€“ Ensures **HIPAA & GDPR compliance** with encryption and access controls.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python-based UI framework)  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django for API handling)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / AWS RDS for secure data storage  
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  

## **Installation & Setup**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/patient-health-dashboard.git
cd patient-health-dashboard
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Application**  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### **4. Access the Dashboard**  
Open `http://localhost:8501/` in your browser to use the dashboard.  

## **Usage**  
1. **Upload patient health data** (CSV, JSON, or direct API integration).  
2. **View patient profiles** with demographics, vitals, and medical history.  
3. **Analyze trends** and get **AI-powered health predictions**.  
4. **Set alerts** for abnormal health metrics.  
5. **Ensure secure access** with role-based authentication.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
ðŸš€ **Telemedicine Integration** â€“ Add video consultations and doctor-patient messaging.  
ðŸ“Š **Wearable Device Support** â€“ Sync health data from smartwatches & fitness trackers.  
ðŸ§  **AI Recommendations** â€“ Suggest personalized treatment plans based on health trends.
